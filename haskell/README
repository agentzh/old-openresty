This is a RestyScript compiler for OpenResty written in Haskell.

To build this program, you should first install GHC and its Parsec library. On Ubuntu/Debian, the following commands would be sufficient:

    $ sudo apt-get install ghc6 libghc6-parsec-dev

After that, you can build this compiler by the following command:

    $ make

The resulting binary executable will be bin/openresty

To run the test suite, simply issue

    $ make test
