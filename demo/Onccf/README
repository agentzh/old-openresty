This is the source code for the site http://www.onccf.com .

For now, a temporary instance of this site is running at

    http://agentzh.org/misc/onccf/out/#menu/home

but it will soon be moved to the domain www.onccf.com when it's ready.

To generate this site, you need a complete OpenResty source tree, perl,
and the Jemplate module on CPAN. Then you can issue the following command:

    $ make

The resulting site will be in the out/ directory ready for deployment :)

There's also a small test suite for the JavaScript file js/pod2html.js.
To run this test suite, simply enter the command

    $ prove -r t

Note that you need perl and several other CPAN modules like Test::Base,
JavaScript::SpiderMonkey, and JSON::XS.
