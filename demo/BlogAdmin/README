This is the source for the blog administration site http://openresty.org/blogadmin/

How to setup the site:

    $ sudo cpan Jemplate WWW::OpenResty YAML
    $ make
    $ firefox out/index.html &

Note that you need the whole OpenResty source tree to build this site.
Because some of the .js files are copied over from ../../clients/js/
and somewhere else :)
