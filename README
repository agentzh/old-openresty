NAME
    OpenResty - General-purpose web service platform for web applications

VERSION
    This document describes OpenResty 0.3.20 released on July 31, 2008.

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the server-side OpenResty web service protocol.
    It provides scriptable and extensible web services for both server-side
    and client-side (pure AJAX) web applications.

    Currently this module can serve as a public web interface to a
    distributive or desktop PostgreSQL database system. In particular, it
    provides roles, models, views, actions, captchas, the minisql language,
    and many more to the web users.

    "Another framework?" No, no, no, not all!

    OpenResty is *not* a web application framework like Jifty or Catalyst.
    Rather, it is

    *   A REST wrapper for relational databases

    *   A web runtime for 100% JavaScript web sites and other RIAs.

    *   A "meta web site" supporting other sites via web services.

    *   A handy personal or company database which can be accessed from
        anywhere on the web.

    *   A (sort of) competitor for the Facebook Data Store API.

    We're already running an instance of the OpenResty server on our Yahoo!
    China's production machines:

    <http://api.openresty.org/=/version>

    And there're several (pure-client-side) web sites alreadying taking
    advantage of the services:

    OpenResty's admin site

    agentzh's blog and EEEE Works' blog

    See OpenResty::Spec::Overview for more detailed information.

    OpenResty::CheatSheet also provides a good enough summary for the REST
    interface.

    You'll find my slides for the D2 conference interesting as well:

CAVEATS
    This library is still in the beta phase and the API is still in flux.
    We're just following the "release early, releaes often" guideline. So
    please check back often ;)

INSTALLATION
