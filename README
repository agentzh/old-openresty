First of all, please run "perl Makefile.PL" to check missing dependencies:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ sudo make -f Makefile  # This will install missing dependencies

To run "make test" or "make debug", you need to have lighttpd and postgres installed.
Also you need to create an empty database named "test" and also make user
'agentzh' a Pg login account (with the password 'agentzh').

Also give read/write access to lighttpd's log file:

    $ chmod 777 /var/log/lighttpd/error.log
    $ chmod 777 /var/log/lighttpd

Sample lighttpd configuration:

# lighttpd.conf

server.modules              = (
            "mod_fastcgi",
            ...
  )

fastcgi.server = (
    "/=" => (
        "openapi" => (
            "socket"       => "/tmp/openapi.socket",
            "check-local"  => "disable",
            "bin-path"     => "/PATH/TO/YOUR/bin/openapi.pl",
            "bin-environment" => ( "OPENAPI_BACKEND" => "Pg", "OPENAPI_URL_PREFIX" => "" ),
            "min-procs"    => 1,
            "max-procs"    => 5,
            "max-load-per-proc" => 1,
            "idle-timeout" => 20,
        )
    )
)

# Also make sure the following line is commented out:
# url.access-deny            = ( "~", ".inc" )

# END

It's also possible to debug a simple .t file, for instance,

    make t/01-sanity.t

Or use prove to test a remote OpenAPI server, for example:

    OPENAPI_FRONTEND=10.62.136.86 prove t/0*.t

where 10.62.136.86 is the IP (or hostname or URL) of your OpenAPI server
being tested.

To test the Pg cluster rather than the desktop Pg, replace the following line in your lighttpd.conf

        "bin-environment" => ( "OPENAPI_BACKEND" => "Pg", "OPENAPI_URL_PREFIX" => "" ),

with

        "bin-environment" => ( "OPENAPI_BACKEND" => "PgFarm", "OPENAPI_URL_PREFIX" => "" ),
