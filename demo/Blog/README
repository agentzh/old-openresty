This is the source for the blog site http://blog.agentzh.org .

How to setup the site:

* First of all, ask agentzh for an OpenAPI account by writing to agentzh@yahoo.cn

* cd into this directory and enter the following commands:

    $ sudo cpan Jemplate WWW::OpenResty
    $ script/init.pl -u your_account -p your_password
    $ vim js/blog.js  # change "agentzh" to your account name
    $ vim Makefile    # change blog_name and blog_desc to your own
    $ make
    $ firefox out/index.html &

Note that you need the whole OpenResty source tree to build this site.
Because some of the .js files are copied over from ../../clients/js/
and somewhere else :)
