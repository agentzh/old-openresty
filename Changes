Change Log for OpenResty

0.4.0 XXX
* now we use Net::Server::PreFork for our standalone HTTP server.

0.3.20 Jul 31 2008
* started an initial (naive) implementaion of OpenHesty, a pure Haskell rewrite of the Perl OpenResty server.
* demo/Blog - renamed the anchor in favor of the style #foo/bar/baz.
* demo/Blog - added full-text-search interface via Pg's tsearch2 support.
* no longer checks model existence in aliased subquery.
* now we do check model existence in PUT view.
* perl minisql compiler: added support for "order by proc(...)".
* perl minisql compiler: allowed "is not null".
* Model API - added some geometric data types to the Model handler, i.e. point, line, lseg, and path.

0.3.19 Jul 25 2008
* perl minisql compiler: implemented subquery in from clause and where clause.
* now we cache the view definition during view invokation as well.
* added the frontend.use_gzip option to the config file and added builtin gzip support to the OpenResty server.
* added the script bin/test-account-admin.sh.
* now the old minisql parser supports "from foo as bar".
* added jsmin support to demo/Admin and demo/Blog as well.
* demo/Admin - added total row count to the model row page.
* get_all_accounts now sets the current user to _global before querying _global._accounts, which fixed the "\u" crash after "\u foo".
* fixed the email address in POD.
* added the misc dir to Makefile.PL's no_index.
* now we sort the account list while doing \u in the OpenResty Shell.
* added --ignore-dup-error and --add-id options to the bin/import-model.pl script.
* set_user now include the "public" schema in the search_path as well.

0.3.18 Jul 22 2008
* Builtin parameters like user, password, session, use_cookie, limit/count, offset, last_response, var, callback, and charset are not renamed to the form with a leading underscore, as in _user, _password, _session, _use_cookie, _limit/_count, _offset, _last_response and etc. The old form is still supported in the short term but is now deprecated.
* added missing files for misc/restylog/.
* (highly) experimental PL/Perl support (just as a proof of concept).

0.3.17 Jul 18 2008
* now we always sort the model/role/view/feed list by id asc.
* now the "type" attribute is no longer optional while creating models and columns.

* updated the docs to reflect that we host the admin site now at http://openresty.org/admin/.
* added an onerror handler to openresty's get method and now it croaks on failed HTTP requests like 404, 503 and bad address :)
* demo/Admin - fixed an IE issue in admin.js regarding deleting a model row and adding the first model row.
* demo/Admin - now it displays the loading flag during logging and also croaks on bad request by means of openresty.js's new onerror handler.
* added the LICENSE file.
* added debian packaging utilty. now "make -f dev.mk debian" will create a .deb file for OpenResty.
