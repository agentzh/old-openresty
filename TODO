TODO items for OpenAPI

* Create pg_XXX tables in sql injection tests.
* Design and implement the login interface (i.e. /=/login/user/...) [done]
* Design and implement roles and ACL, /=/roles/... [done]
* Captcha support in the login interface. [done]
* Work out the empty test cases in t/03-model.t [done]
* Shortcut for row_count sub.
  (laser++ said "select count(*)" is expensive in Pg.)
* More tests for t/10-limits.t.
  (i.e. INSERT_LIMIT, POST_LEN_LIMIT, PUT_LEN_LIMIT, and MAX_SELECT_LIMIT)
  [done]
* Tests for unknown HTTP methods (like TRACE, OPTIONS, and CONNECT).
* Tests for common SQL injection patthers.
* Coverage testing for the test sutie.
* Review and polish the existing test suite (under t/)
* Added Apache config directives to README.
* Hook laye++'s PCR-based miniSQL parser into OpenAPI. [canceled]
* Prerequiste groups in Makefile.PL. [done]
* move all initialize SQLs into a independent file [laser]
* add a global default PostgreSQL user, named by anonymous/public etc., to act as a read-only role in PG (clusters) [laser]
* add a per-model PostgreSQL user/role, act as writer for all permitted write from the roles of model itself.
* use a status machine to recognize different url pattern [laser]
* use $self->select() instead $Backend->do() in OpenAPI.pm [laser] [done]
* different URL mode for view implementation, should clearify the url path meaning [laser]
* mv Backend from OpenAPI to lib, seems it belongs there [laser]
* move some work (like has_somethig()) into store procedore into store procedure to minimum c/s interact [leiyh,laser]
* make OpenAPI into a database interfaces [laser]
  ** add proc support
* make OpenAPI meta data store in another special meta-schema, naming by prefixing '_' to username, e.g. "_username", then
  we create 2 schema when creating a user: _username & username, and create 2 different database roles (PostgreSQL role)
  when creating user, one for access meta data, we could call it meta-user, the other for access user data; all meta data,
  like _models, _columns, _views will be keep in meta-schema, thus we could use PostgreSQL security model to make maximum
  protection for us. [laser,leiyh,angentzh]
* Tests for PUT method in Role [shangerdi]
* Backup and Restore data for promotion [shangerdi]
* Tests for session manager on login [shangerdi]
* Tests for captcha [shangerdi]
* Tests for logout [shangerdi]
