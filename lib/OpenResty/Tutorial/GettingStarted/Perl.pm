=head1 NAME

OpenResty::Tutorial::GettingStarted - Zero to OpenResty for Perl programmers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial should give you everything you need to start with an OpenResty account using Perl.

=head1 Prerequisites

You should already have an account on an OpenResty server. You can either set up an OpenResty server on your own machine or just request an account on our Yahoo! China's production server by sending an email to C<agentzh@yahoo.cn>. If you're running your own instance of the OpenResty server, you can use the following command to create an account (named C<foo>) for yourself:

    $ bin/openresty adduser foo

You'll be prompted to enter a password for the C<Admin> role of your C<foo> account.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll assume you own an account named C<foo> whose C<Admin> role's password is C<hello1234>.
