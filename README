First of all, please run "perl Makefile.PL" to check missing dependencies.

To run "make test" or "make debug", you need to have lighttpd and postgres installed.
Also you need to create an empty database named "test" and also make user
'agentzh' a Pg login account (with the password 'agentzh').

Sample lighttpd configuration:

server.modules              = (
            "mod_fastcgi",
            ...
  )


# lighttpd.conf
fastcgi.server = (
    "" => (
        "openapi" => (
            "socket"       => "/tmp/openapi.socket",
            "check-local"  => "disable",
            "bin-path"     => "/YOUR/PATH/TO/openapi.pl",
            "min-procs"    => 1,
            "max-procs"    => 5,
            "max-load-per-proc" => 1,
            "idle-timeout" => 20,
        )
    )
)
# END
