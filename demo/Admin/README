This is the source code for the site http://openresty.org/admin/ .

To build the site:

    $ make

Then out/ will hold the binary site ready for deployment.

Note that you need the whole OpenResty source tree to build this site.
Because some of the .js files are copied over from ../../clients/js/
and somewhere else :)
